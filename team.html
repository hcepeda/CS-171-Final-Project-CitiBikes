            <p> Peter Ayala is a senior in Lowell House studying Statistics and Computer Science. Outside of the classroom, he regularly turns down strong recruitment efforts
                from HCCG even though he struck gold with sophomore and junior internships at Bain & Company, where he will return after graduating as an Associate Consultant. In his free time, he is an avid watcher of The Office and Big Mouth.

            <br><br> <p> Deedee Jiang is a junior in Eliot House studying Psychology in order to hone her skills of studying the odd and frustratingly complex behavior of
            the Chads of the world. When she isn't stunting on everyone with her intellectual prowess and amazing visualization skills, she performs regularly as a tender wholesome tookis
                with the Harvard Ballet Company. In her free time, she likes to tag Larry in memes on subtle asian traits.

            <br><br> <p> Hernan Cepeda is a senior in Leverett House studying Economics. Hailing all the way from Houston, TX, Hernan has trekked many miles
            to make it to Harvard. As the future governor of Texas, his first mandate will be to require all students take CS171, since the skills learned in that class were
            essential to the logical and effective storytelling in his successful campaign.

            <br><br> <p> Sherry is a senior in Currier House studying Chemical and Physical Biology. When sheâ€™s not running around trying to figure out what in the world organic chemistry is, you can find her trying to come up with math puns to impress her section.
                In her free time, she serves as the Vice President and the Loeb Mainstage Coordinator for the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club and as a choreographer for the Modern Dance Company.
                She's having an absolute blast in CS171! </p>
