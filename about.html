                <h1>The Beginnings</h1>
                <p>In an effort to reduce air pollution, road damage, collisions,
                  and congestion, the New York City Department of Transportation
                  (NYCDOT) researched alternative forms of transportations to
                  service the city of New York in 2008. In an effort to reduce
                  the number of short trips taken within the city, they advocated
                  for and proposed a bike sharing program in which users could
                  borrow and drop off bikes at designated locations.

                  In May of 2013, after some initial delays due to Hurricane Sandy,
                  Citibike began its operations with a total of 332 bike stations servicing
                  6,000 bicycles.</p>

            <br>
            <p> The above line chart depicts the number of trips that taken each day since CitiBike's inception.
                While the number of trips consistently dips during the winter time, both the peaks and troughs of the graph show
                a consistent increase in the use of CitiBikes around NYC. </p>

        <h1>Look at how popular it's become!</h1>
        <p>CitiBike did not expect its bike sharing program to be as popular as it became,
          especially within its first year of service. Its peak number of
          travelers within the first year was 42,010 trips, achieved on August 6,
          2013. Citi Bike encountered numerous issues within the first years,
          particularly due to software and station demand inequality.
          Numerous van drivers were hired to distribute bikes equally across stations
          and deal with the overflow issues that many stations were having.</p>
        <p> It wasn't until midway through 2015, however, that CitiBike began to
          rapidly expand its station offerings. Until then, most stations existed
          within the Mid and Downtown regions of Manhattan, but have since expanded
          towards Uptown, Harlem, Brooklyn, Queens, and Jersey City. In
          fact, CitiBike just announced a partnership with Lyft in November 2018 to
          aggressively expand both their station and bike counts.</p>
        <p> The line graph belows shows the expansion of CitiBike through time.
          The black line represents the unique number of stations in existence,
          and the red line represents the unique number of bicycles that have been used
          to the date. We see a very strong correlation between the two, which makes
          sense intuitively, though it is very interesting that Citibike has shown a consistent pattern of
          rapid expansion of offerings roughly every 12 months.</p>

        <h1> Users Travel Preferences </h1>
        <p> In an attempt to see trends in travel preferences for the entire CitiBike history,
        a random sample of 1 million points were taken to create the chord diagram below. Each arc
        segment represents a different New York City neighborhood as defined by the city of New York.
        The color of the segments represent the borough locations within New York. This data was obtained by referencing
        the latitude and longitude coordinates of each station to the GeoJson polygons as defined by the city of New York here.
        </p>
        <p> Hover over each of the chords to see how people travel from a starting location to their destinations.
          Hovering over an arc segment will show the percentage of all trips that originate from that neighborhood. Hovering over a chord will show the percentage of riders in each direction.
          For example, 22.3% of all riders that start from the East Village go to the West Village, and 9.8% of riders that start from the West Village go to the East Village. Lastly, in order to be included in the diagram, the directional pathway required at least 10 occurrences from the 1 million sampled.
